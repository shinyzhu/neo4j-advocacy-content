## How to view the content with Docsify

You'd probably find there are `package` json files. Yes! I'm using Docsify to host the content. You can do it as well by just 2 steps:

1. Install Docsify

```
npm i docsify-cli
```

2. Run Docsify

```
npx docsify serve docs
```

Then you can visit http://localhost:3000 to see the content.

## How to contribute your content

As simple as following the steps:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Add your content under `docs/yyyy-mm` folder with English file name.
3. Put static resources (Images, ext files etc) under the folder named the same as your `md` file.
4. Submit PR when the content is ready.

I use Typora to edit `md` files. You'd follow this Image settings if you like:
